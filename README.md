# TelegramBashBots
ðŸ¤– Simple Telegram bots written purely with scripts in Bash

___

## About

I have created this repository in order to host a series of bots for Telegram written entirely in Bash. I know that it is not an optimal language for these cases, but I do not intend to create a huge project; it is simply about **creating small bots with specific functions**.

## Bots

- **I Shorten Your Link:** Generate shortened links from the link we send you as a message. Currently supports ouo.io, but more services will be added soon.

## Contributing

Any contribution is welcome! You can use the bots created as a reference and help you with the [Google's Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html). Any requirement or request can be made in the [Issues](https://github.com/PandaFoss/TelegramBashBots/issues) section.

## Donate

If you value the work of this project, I would appreciate any type of donation.
